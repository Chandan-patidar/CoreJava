 Define :- The wrapper class in Java provides the mechanism to convert primitive into object and object into primitive.

 :- autoboxing and unboxing feature convert primitives into objects and objects into primitives automatically.

Primitive Type	  |    Wrapper class
__________________|_____________________
boolean	          |      Boolean
char	          |      Character
byte	          |      Byte
short	          |      Short
int 	          |      Integer
long	          |      Long
float	          |       Float
double	          |      Double


 A.Autoboxing:-

 The automatic conversion of primitive data type into its corresponding wrapper class is known as autoboxing, for
  example, byte to Byte, char to Character, int to Integer, long to Long, float to Float, boolean to Boolean,
  double to Double, and short to Short.


 B. Unboxing

 The automatic conversion of wrapper type into its corresponding primitive type is known as unboxing. It is the reverse
  process of autoboxing. Since Java 5, we do not need to use the intValue() method of wrapper classes to convert
  the wrapper type into primitives.
