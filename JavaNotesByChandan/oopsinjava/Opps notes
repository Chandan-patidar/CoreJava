# Object-Oriented Programming

Aim :-The main aim of object-oriented programming is to implement real-world entities, for example, object, classes,
       abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, etc.

 Class :-

 Object:-


1. Encapsulation

 Defination :- Encapsulation in Java refers to integrating data (variables) and code (methods) into a single unit. In encapsulation,
 a class's variables are hidden from other classes and can only be accessed by the methods of the class in which they are found.
                                                                or

Encapsulation in Java is a process of wrapping code (method ) and data(Variable) together into a single unit, for example, a capsule which
is mixed of several medicines.

-> Given this, getters and setters are also known as accessors and mutators,


* method which is used in Encapsulation

1.getter method :- Getters: These are the methods used in Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS) which helps to access the
private attributes from a class.


2. setter method :- Setters: These are the methods used in OOPS feature which helps to set the value to private
attributes in a class.





Advantages of Encapsulation :-
1.Better Control
  Encapsulation provides ultimate control over the data members and data methods inside the class.

  Getter and Setter
  The standard IDEs provide in-built support for ‘Getter and Setter’ methods, which increases the programming pace.

  Security
  Encapsulation prevents access to data members and data methods by any external classes. The encapsulation process improves the security of the encapsulated data.

  Flexibility
  Changes made to one part of the code can be successfully implemented without affecting any other part of the code.

Data Hiding vs. Encapsulation in Java

                 Data Hiding                                 |                       Data Encapsulation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   1.Data hiding can be considered as the parent process     |       Encapsulation is a sub-process of data hiding
                                                             |
   2.Access specifier is always private                      |       Access specifier can be private and public
                                                             |
   3.Data hiding is about hiding method implementation       |        Encapsulation is about combining methods with data members
                                                             |
   4.The main motto is to hide data and its implementation   |       The main motto is to combine data and their methods
